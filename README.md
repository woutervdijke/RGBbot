# RGBbot
A Twitter bot that tweets random RGB colours with a picture of that colour

RGBbot was built in Node.js. It uses the great [Twit API Client](https://github.com/ttezel/twit).

To use this bot, create [a new Twitter app](http://apps.twitter.com) and paste the consumer key, access token and secrets into RGBbot.js.
It can be kept alive by creating a daemon using [the PM2 Node process manager](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2).

A running example can be found on Twitter at [@RGB_bot](http://www.twitter.com/rgb_bot)!
